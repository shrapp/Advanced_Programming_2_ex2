# Advanced_Programming_2_ex2

this repo contains three project: a MVC project, an Api project, and also a react project.

to run this app, run "MessageApp" project.

the "MessageApp" project uses a React project that is built statically,
but the original project is in this repository, under "reactMessageApp",
and can be seen and run by "npm start".

the "MessagesWebApi" project is just the prototype of the api controller, so it can run too but all of his functionality is built-in MessageApp.

If you want, you can use some hard-coded users to test the app:

username: 1, password: 1

username: alice, password: allice

username: bob, password: bob
